    Shazkho'S CRUD Plugin - Edit view
    ---------------------------------------
    Displays a form to modify a single record. It works but must be modified to fit your needs.
    REQUIRES LARAVEL COLLECTIVE TO WORK AS INTENDED.

    IMPORTANT:  This view MUST be called using "renderCreate" function con controller. It can
                obviously be called directly, just be careful, some variables are dinamically created.

    File version:       1.0
    Version date:       2019/06/03
